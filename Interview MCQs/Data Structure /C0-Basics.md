### 1. What is a data structure?

a) A programming language  
b) A collection of algorithms  
c) A way to store and organize data  
d) A type of computer hardware  
**View Answer**

**Answer:** c  
**Explanation:**  
A data structure is a way to store and organize data efficiently, enhancing access and manipulation, unlike programming languages, algorithms, or computer hardware.

### 2. What are the disadvantages of arrays?

a) Index value of an array can be negative  
b) Elements are sequentially accessed  
c) Data structure like queue or stack cannot be implemented  
d) There are chances of wastage of memory space if elements inserted in an array are lesser than the allocated size  
**View Answer**

**Answer:** d  
**Explanation:**  
Arrays are of fixed size. If we insert elements less than the allocated size, unoccupied positions canâ€™t be used again. Wastage will occur in memory.

### 4. The data structure required to check whether an expression contains a balanced parenthesis is?

a) Queue  
b) Stack  
c) Tree  
d) Array  
**View Answer**

**Answer:** b  
**Explanation:**  
The stack is a simple data structure in which elements are added and removed based on the LIFO principle. Open parenthesis is pushed into the stack and a closed parenthesis pops out elements till the top element of the stack is its corresponding open parenthesis. If the stack is empty, the parenthesis is balanced; otherwise, it is unbalanced.

### 5. Which of the following is not an application of a stack?

a) Data Transfer between two asynchronous processes  
b) Compiler Syntax Analyzer  
c) Tracking of local variables at runtime  
d) A parentheses balancing program  
**View Answer**

**Answer:** a  
**Explanation:**  
Data transfer between two asynchronous processes uses the queue data structure for synchronization. The rest are all stack applications.
